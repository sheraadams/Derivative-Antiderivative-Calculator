## About the Project
This is a derivative and integral calculator for mathematical modeling and engineering functions to fit a curve. The application was programmed in Python using Tkinter, Future, and Pillow libraries for GUI. 

Check out this program's [Java Android app version here](https://github.com/sheraadams/Calculus-Helper-Android-App).

And check out the [UX Research here](https://github.com/sheraadams/UI-UX).

## UX Research Data

To make this app more accessible to those with moderate to significant visual impairments, I conducted some preliminary research to determine what colors and fonts were most accessible to all audiences. You can find [the UI/UX research here](https://github.com/sheraadams/UI-UX). 

## The Android Mobile App

The mobile app features derivative and integral calculation, side-by-side and singular graphing. You can find [the mobile app here](https://github.com/sheraadams/Calculus-Helper-Android-App).

## Instructions

To use the application, first use the terminal to install the dependencies with the following command:

Bash:
```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install future
pip install pillow
```
